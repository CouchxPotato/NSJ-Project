# NSJ-Project
Training cost calculator for North Susex Judo
This a basic training cost calculator which calculates the overall cost of the training of the athlete that registers with NSJ and then completes the registration.

This is the first version of the cost calculator and further versions are under development.

Next version will get optimised to work properly on the space and time complexity principles and will have some added features like the option to make corrections in
a specific part of the form instead of re-filling the entire form again. This is will improve the user experience and make it more easy to use.

Mind that according to NSJ, the atheletes of the beginner training plan are not allowed to participate in the competition and hence they will not be asked to choose a 
weight category as it is for only the atheletes of the intermediate and advanced training plans.
